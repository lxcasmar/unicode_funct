# unicode_funct description
A program to accept any string `name` as an input and a positive integer `n` such that
`0 < n < len(name)`. The program will find the nth character in `name` and return its ASCII value.
Alternatively, if the user enters `ALL` as the input for `n`, the program will return the ASCII values of every
character in the string.
